# :pirate_flag: Captain Hooks :pirate_flag:

Captain Hooks is a collection of clever react hooks to help make everyday react development a bit more delightful. These hooks are ones that I have used in my own personal projects and thought I'd make them available to anyone else interested.

## Installation

If you're using `npm`:

```bash
npm i @joshreep/captain-hooks
```

If you're using `yarn`

```bash
yarn add @joshreep/captain-hooks
```

## The hooks:

### [useAsync](./src/useAsync) - A hook for rendering dynamic UIs based on the status of an async request
